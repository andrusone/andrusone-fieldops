A ping from the Canvas app hit—  
Assignment: “Due now. Don’t submit?”  
I hadn’t logged in,  
My patience wore thin—  
Was this class, or panic writ lit?

The syllabus once made me bold,  
But now it’s a scroll to behold.  
Each date’s a surprise,  
Each quiz a disguise—  
Each deadline’s aggressively cold.

I breathe… then it pings once again,  
“Reminder: your post was due when?”  
My schedule’s a mess,  
But yes, I confess—  
I thrive in this cortisol den.
